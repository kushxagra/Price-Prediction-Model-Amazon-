ðŸ›’ Amazon Price Prediction Model

Predicting product prices on Amazon using data-driven regression models.
This project focuses on analyzing product features such as category, ratings, reviews, and brand information to build an accurate price prediction model using machine learning.

ðŸ“Œ Overview

E-commerce platforms like Amazon contain vast product listings with dynamic pricing based on multiple factors â€” brand reputation, ratings, category, and demand trends.
This project aims to predict the price of Amazon products using structured product metadata and text-based features, enabling insights into pricing patterns and assisting in competitive pricing strategies.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Clean and preprocess Amazon product data

Perform feature engineering for categorical, textual, and numerical features

Build and evaluate multiple regression models

Optimize the best-performing model using hyperparameter tuning

Interpret feature importance to understand price drivers

ðŸ§  ML Pipeline
1. Data Collection

Dataset scraped or obtained from Amazon product listings via public datasets or APIs.

Typical fields include:

product_name, category, brand, rating, review_count, description, price

2. Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and outliers

Encoded categorical variables (category, brand) using One-Hot or Label Encoding

Cleaned textual data (product name and description) using NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)

Scaled numerical features (rating, review_count) using StandardScaler

3. Feature Engineering

Extracted useful features such as:

Average rating buckets

Review-to-rating ratio

Word count from descriptions

Category-level price averages

Performed dimensionality reduction (optional, using PCA or feature selection)

4. Model Building

Models tested:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

HistGradientBoostingRegressor (final model â€“ best performance)

5. Evaluation Metrics

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

RÂ² Score

6. Model Optimization

GridSearchCV and cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning

Feature importance analysis for interpretability
